## Problem Statement
- The problem is to reduce the cost due to unnecessary repairs by Classifying the Failure type faced by Machine so the user will have clear mind set how deal with problem according to failure made by machine. So it is required to minimize the false predictions.

## Project Overview
- The system in focus to Classify which type of Failure Machine is facing for Maintenance purpose on Basis of Air Temparature, Process Temparature, Rotational Speed, Tool Wear, Torque produced by Machine.


## Approach:

- The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine learning algorithms thatâ€™s best fit for the above case.

## Setup
#### Step - 1 Install the Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Step - 2 Run app.py file
```bash
python main.py
```
